# ViewingActivity

Calculate your total time spent using [Netflix Viewing Activity](https://www.netflix.com/ViewingActivity) csv file

##Justification

Create and deploy a project with [Angular](https://angular.io/) so I can learn the framework. Also to show my sister all the time she spends on tv :grin:

##Features
1. Consume of API with HttpClient via a Service
2. Use Routing module 
3. Use an external library ([Papa Parser](https://www.papaparse.com/))
4. Poorly Use of [RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/) library :sob:
5. CSS Flexbox

##Nice to have (coming soon)
- Cache httpRequest / httpResponse
- Better Style
- [GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/) (Lots of reading needed)
- Split **time-result** component
- Stats Component and be able to share a graph with the results
